**A Computer Graphics project using C++ involves creating interactive and visually appealing applications that manipulate graphical elements. These projects can range from implementing basic geometric shapes and transformations to advanced rendering techniques like ray tracing or shading algorithms. Students may develop programs to simulate 2D and 3D environments, design graphical user interfaces, or even build simple games.**

**By leveraging C++'s power and efficiency, developers can explore topics such as rasterization, lighting effects, and texture mapping, fostering a deeper understanding of graphics programming principles and techniques.**
